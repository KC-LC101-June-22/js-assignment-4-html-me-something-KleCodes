         <h2>Tacos</h2>
         <p>
           Tacos are by far my favorite food.  I could eat tacos everyday and be just fine lol.  Lately, I am loving birria tacos &#40;pictured&#41;.  The  consome makes all the difference in a good birria taco.  It needs to be packed with flavor.  Be carefuel cooking it though&#59; the vapors from cooking the peppers can be overwhelming.

         <h2>Mac and Cheese</h2>
         <p>
            Mac and cheese is definitely a close 2nd when it comes to my favorite foods.  I eat it by itself as a meal all the time.  Traditional recipes are best for me&#44; but I can sometimes handle it with bbq meat or seafood mixed in.

         <h2>Peanut Butter</h2>
         <p>
            Peanut butter is another favorite of mine.  Specifically, I love peanut butter with apples.  It is an excellent snack when I&#39;m craving something sweet.  My next goal is to try my hand a making peanut butter in the Vitamix.
